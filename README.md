Everyday Goals  ("*" means goal was met)

Monday 14 (*) - Today we finallized our groups. One of our main goals for today was to brainstorm ideas about what we wanted to present to our fellow classmates. Today we decided to make a robot that can adapt (turn, move backwards) from obstructing objects that may be infront of it.

Tuesday 15 (*) - Todays goal we wanted to make the code and started planning the design of our robot specifically thinking obout how we can make the edison robot detect objects infront of it.

Wednesday 16 (*) - Todays main goal was to finalize the main part of the code and create a design that can allow the Edison robot to detect things that are infront of it. We created 2 arms that are attatched to the front of the Edison robot that bend (Because of the rubberbands) and hit the sensor on top when the robot hits an object.

Thursday 17 () - Todays main goal was to troublshoot the errors in our code and try to make the robot respond more successfully in responding to the objects it may encounter.





End Goal - having a robot that can succesfully menuvuer in a classroom.
